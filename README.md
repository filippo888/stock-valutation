# stock-valutation

In this project I exploit a simple ratio to predict the current price of a certain firm. You can find the results of the analysis in the [main.jpynb](https://github.com/filippo888/stock-valutation/main.jpynb) file. 

I take the data scraping [yhaoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) web site, all the scaping part and calculation are in the [helper.py](https://github.com/filippo888/stock-valutation/helper.py) file.
